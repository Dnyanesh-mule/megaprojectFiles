  Term – The term of Gram Panchayat is for 5 years. It is mandatory to hold elections within 6 months after dissolution of Gram Panchayat and no extension is allowed under any circumstances. The State Government has the right to dissolve the Gram Panchayat. If more than half of the members resign, the state government directs for by-elections or decides to dismiss.

  Sarpanch and Deputy Sarpanch
  Sarpanch is the executive head of Gram Panchayat. The members elected from Gram Panchayat elect Sarpanchs and Deputy Sarpanchs from among themselves.

The post of Sarpanch is reserved while the post of Sub-Sarpanch is open and the reservation draw is made in the Collector’s office before the election. The District Collector issues a notification to convene the first meeting of the Gram Panchayat after the election. An officer appointed by the District Collector presides over this meeting.
